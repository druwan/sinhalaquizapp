# Sinhala Quiz App

Web Application that test you on some very very basic sinhala. A simple way of learning a new vocabulary is the use of a **quiz**. The plan for this application is to be able to _choose a category_ and see different questions with answers that are _clickable_.

## Objective

The goal is to create an educational app, and simultaneously learn sinhala and deepen my developer skills.
